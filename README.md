## The Odyssey by Homer  
### Timeline

### Terms
`complicated` - of many turns  
`kleos` - one's honor, status, social identity, glory.  
`katabasis` - hell, the underground  
### Context
Odysseus is a king who fought in the Trojan War, far from home, Ithaca. The Odyssey is a poem composed of several books describing the great acts of Odysseus as he travels back home. The way back is depicted as a dangerous road, filled with danger and obstacles which impede his efforts, his yearning and burning desire for home. 
### Odysseus' character
Odysseus is a multi-sided character in which he depicts himself as a strong warrior in the novel of the Odyssey, in which he writes himself. He is a strong, sly, heroic, glorious leader who leads him and his men from an expedition at sea back towards home, Ithaca. We are set into a Greek setting where there are many gods which create problems for Odysseus and his crew, but his crafty and highly strategic nature provides his escape. However, his character is shown to be more complicated, intertwined with many ironic moments and performative actions. Odysseus seems to get himself out of many situations, but he seems to put him and his crew in those situations in the first place. He seems to perform for his crew: in that he motivates his crew through his emotion, but all of the passion seems to be not an outpouring of true heart but as a means for an end. Odysseus wants to be remembered; all of his character seems to be his incessent craving for glory, for `kleos`, if you will. One of the reasons he does this is to assert his capability and competence to run his kingdom when he returns.  
He needs his adventures to shore up his slippering identity: his kleos is at stake!  
### Tone/how the book is told
1. Language attuned to acts, not to feelings or motives. We rarely see the feelings of Odysseus
2. Adventure is not a way of experiencing the world, but as a public affair; to gain `kleos` (although both might be true, but rather it is not talked about; we never get Odysseus' motives, or his take on his experiences)
3. Regular people have no place in the poem because they have no `kleos`

## What is setting?
`chronotope`: time space - how the setting sets the timeline (past, present, future) and pace of the story. A hyper futuristic metropolis would have fast paced, forward looking lines of thought about civilization and how the government is run, while a book describing the aftermath of a war would have many flashbacks and reminiscing on previous war experiences and camaraderie.   

## Medieval - Yvain
interlacing of plots
yvain has access to adventures; peasant do not - yet yvain asks the ugly peasant for adventure; and this is how he finds a stone in which he pours water on in order to find adventure (fighting a knight in a storm)  
the juxtaposition between the outside and inside of the castle: where inside, the chivalrous nature of knights are shown, while outside the chaotic nature of the wilderness filled with dragons and adventure takes place  
`Redemption` - redeeming one's status after tarnishing it  
`Vindication` - redeeming one's status that has been tarnished due to external factors  
Reputation vs Anonymity

### Medieval "Noble Violence"
One must go to war, do tournaments; level of courtly love, chivalry.   
Sets the scene, the understanding of the motivations behind actions, the heart of the story.   
### Yvain's identity
He starts off the story as a chivalrous knight, seeking adventure and glory. He chases after his status, showing courtly love to Laudine;   
He dissolves into madness after failing to show his commitment to Laudine, and Laudine rejects him completely, telling him to never return - he ruins himself, and thus the world around him, for life hinges around him (in King Arthur's court, with Laudine, etc). It seems as if the plot moves as his character changes...  
He then redeems himself after doing many noble deeds, coming to Lunete's rescue by fighting off 3 knights, rescuing the sweatshop and maidens of a castle controlled by two demons; even going so far as to offer up his life for Gawain.   
The `lion` is important because it represents his sense of changed identity, his sense of pride and status. It has become part of himself? Externalizing honor  

## Western - Shane
Shane, Myrian, and Starett - Love Triangle  
Based on Wyoming  
The movie is quite symmetrical: 
1. Shane argues with Joe in the beginning and fights with him at the end
2. Joey cocks shotgun in front of Shane, Shane gets shot with shotgun at the end (but doesn't die)
3. Shane emerges from the landscape, shane escapes into the landscape
The movie brings to question whether Joey will grow up to be like Shane, a gunslinger, or Joe, a hardworking farmer
Violence is used as a form of reconciliation, to settle matters
Shane's past as a gunslinger makes him some sort of a ghost, who understands the value of life and the weight of death. (same with Wilson)

## On the Eve of Modernity
Robinson Cruso  
### Terms
`formal realism`:   
1. Claims to authenticity: blurring fact and fiction. To make fiction feel like an authentic report of everyday life.
2. Rejection of conventional plots
3. Individualism
4. Specify temporal and spatial aspects
5. Specify Causality: Things must happen for a reason.
### Plot
#### Part 1
1. Grew up in a middle class family: Father does not want Robinson to leave. He wants him to stay at home where it is safe, where he can enjoy the luxury of life. He says to Robinson so profusely. Robinson is deterred for a few weeks or so, but his drive for adventure at sea entices him so much that he leaves without his parents' consent - for neither his mother nor his father would grant him any such thing.
2. Robinson then sailed to sea: the first two times he was nearly swamped. As it were, mountains of water towered over the ship, in which the crew had to chop off the masts in order to stay afloat.
3. Robinson then garnered his own crew and decided to sail out for adventure; however, he was captured by `Moors` (Pirates) and spent two years in captivity (to Morocco). He escaped because he was a fisherman, taking a ship out to sea and throwing off his `Moor` supervisor. He and `Xury` then set off to sail for adventure themselves, freeing themselves from the Pirates.
4. Robinson sails to the island of the Negroes, where he stocks up on corn and water. He kills a few creatures on his way for skin.
5. He is taken in by some European boat. This boat drops him off in Brazil. The captain buys everything he has, giving Robinson a huge fortune. He sells Xury, who wanted to be a seafarer with the Captain as well.
6. He now controls a plantation in Brazil and lives on it for 4 years. If he learned his lesson, he would have stayed: yet his yearning for adventure and sea pushed him to embark on a mission to be able to secretly transport Negroes for their plantations (his and his friends').
7. This voyage goes very poorly, leaving him stranded on a random island far away from Brazil and far away from his comfort based on his Brazil plantation.
#### Part 2/3
1. Spawned in: grabbed things from a ship and put it onto his raft. He anchors the raft down once high tide starts, because the land was too steep; needed to wait to level it out, lest his cargo falls into the water.
2. He grabs all the cargo from the ship onto land using a raft 11 or 12 trips. Nearly loses much of the heavy materials but still retains a bit of them after falling in.
3. He builds a tent and wants to find drink, food, shelter, and a lookout for the Sea, in case another ship could provide his deliverance.
4. Creates a journal in which he notes his daily log. In this journal he jots how he survives and creates a nice little home for himself in the NNW cave.
5. Notable achievements: He builds a Wall to defend himself against animals.
6. Barley seems to grow out of nowhere, even when there is no reason for it to grow in this sort of environment. He seems to find corn as well.
7. He experiences an earthquake. He finds wreckage of the same ship due to a hurricane and an earthquake. He grabs barrels and brings it back to his home.
8. He gets ill.
9. Sees a vision: 'Seeing all these Things have not brought thee to Repentance, now thou shalt die'
10. Starts to become more and more Christian, referring back to the Bible and living by faith not by sight.
11. Finds `Friday`, who is considered a "savage" that can speak English. He delights in Friday, because he has found someone to speak to.
`avintiure trade` - merchants set out with goods without knowing if there is a market out there for his goods.
### Intuition
Robinson Crusoe is not an adventurous person, but many misfortunes happen and he is forced into adventure due to his drive for money 
Absence of sexuality  
Crusoe only sees social bonding as a means for buisiness, or money; to use contracts as ways for advancement. He only sees people as buisness friends or commodities.   
Crusoe has a hyper-individual personality, in which he is super self seeking and only cares for himself  
Robinson Crusoe seems to be very critical about society.   
Robinson Crusoe is a very unconventional adventure story in that there doesn't exist many typical adventure elements, like the desire to explore; rather, Crusoe is put into adventure scenes in which he does not want to be in - he seems to be thrown into the fire without his consent.  

How does Virginia Woolf read Robinson Crusoe?
1. Thinks of it as repetitive and there is no emotions or soul within the story.
2. Crusoe is very pragmatic and cuts across all of the emotional turmoil and reaction that should be present in the story.
### Terms
`Colonialism`: a practice of domination which involves the subjugation of one pepole to another by conquest and control of one of these groups' lands and resources.   
### Cast Away

`Modernity`: the condition of being modern. A set of cultural, political, economic, and spatial relationships that influence the nature of social life, the economy, and experience of time and space. 
Thinking about industrial matters. Going from farming and a peaceful life to having new problems spring up from the new modern way of life. 
#### Plot

6. He is now lost and doesn't know where to go. He sees the angel wings on the back of the truck at a crossroads and smiles, deciding to go down the path that the angel wings went.
#### Significance of Symbolic Objects
1. Angel Wings - the hope that Chuck will escape and delivered from the island.
2. Wilson - a desire for friendship and connection with other humans.
3. Clock - the fact that Chuck needs to get back home fast or else he will lose Kelly.
#### Significance of Time in Cast Away
Makes events go faster or slower  
1. The main character is always fixated on time. Time controls Chuck's world.

3. Time is very important in capitalism
4. Time is anxiety - Chuck doesn't want to run time.

4. It can be used as an organizational tool (Philias Fogg uses a log)
5. Conflict/Units: time controls the blueprint of conflict.

### Term Test 2
Cast Away, Around the world in 80 days, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Robinson Crusoe
Robinsonade - people stranded in isolation: Robinson Crusoe, Cast away
Chuck Noland is a real adventurer - he is not afraid of doing what it takes; he knows what is best and does it (aka. knocking out that tooth!)
How Chuck's identity changed: Understanding that efficiency isn't everything; ability to understand that time is something to be cherished, not to be rushed through.   
Around the world in 80 days
serialization - sending out a large novel in chunks  
Around the world: accounting for time 
There is going to be a question about importance of time in cast away vs around the world: 
Similarities: efficiency
Differences: living day by day as time passes (fogg does not do sightseeing), but in cast away, Chuck seems to take time as important, but cherishes time more on the island now; does not take a look into efficiency.   
As shown through the angel wings, we can see that he does not have any direction, but knows he can do things not as fast as he used to without everything going to shreds.
