### Terms
`complicated` - of many turns  
`kleos` - one's honor, status, social identity, glory.  
### Context
Odysseus is a king who fought in the Trojan War, far from home, Ithaca. The Odyssey is a poem composed of several books describing the great acts of Odysseus as he travels back home. The way back is depicted as a dangerous road, filled with danger and obstacles which impede his efforts, his yearning and burning desire for home. 
### Odysseus' character
Odysseus is a multi-sided character in which he depicts himself as a strong warrior in the novel of the Odyssey, in which he writes himself. He is a strong, sly, heroic, glorious leader who leads him and his men from an expedition at sea back towards home, Ithaca. We are set into a Greek setting where there are many gods which create problems for Odysseus and his crew, but his crafty and highly strategic nature provides his escape. However, his character is shown to be more complicated, intertwined with many ironic moments and performative actions. Odysseus seems to get himself out of many situations, but he seems to put him and his crew in those situations in the first place. He seems to perform for his crew: in that he motivates his crew through his emotion, but all of the passion seems to be not an outpouring of true heart but as a means for an end. Odysseus wants to be remembered; all of his character seems to be his incessent craving for glory, for `kleos`, if you will. One of the reasons he does this is to assert his capability and competence to run his kingdom when he returns.  
### Tone/how the book is told
1. Language attuned to acts, not to feelings or motives. We rarely see the feelings of Odysseus
2. Adventure is not a way of experiencing the world, but as a public affair; to gain `kleos` (although both might be true, but rather it is not talked about; we never get Odysseus' motives, or his take on his experiences)
3. Regular people have no place in the poem because they have no `kleos`

## What is setting?
`chronotope`: time space - how the setting sets the timeline (past, present, future) and pace of the story. A hyper futuristic metropolis would have fast paced, forward looking lines of thought about civilization and how the government is run, while a book describing the aftermath of a war would have many flashbacks and reminiscing on previous war experiences and camaraderie.
