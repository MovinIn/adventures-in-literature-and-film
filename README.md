### Terms
`complicated` - of many turns  
`kleos` - one's honor, status, social identity, glory.  
`catabasis` - hell, the underground  
### Context
Odysseus is a king who fought in the Trojan War, far from home, Ithaca. The Odyssey is a poem composed of several books describing the great acts of Odysseus as he travels back home. The way back is depicted as a dangerous road, filled with danger and obstacles which impede his efforts, his yearning and burning desire for home. 
### Odysseus' character
Odysseus is a multi-sided character in which he depicts himself as a strong warrior in the novel of the Odyssey, in which he writes himself. He is a strong, sly, heroic, glorious leader who leads him and his men from an expedition at sea back towards home, Ithaca. We are set into a Greek setting where there are many gods which create problems for Odysseus and his crew, but his crafty and highly strategic nature provides his escape. However, his character is shown to be more complicated, intertwined with many ironic moments and performative actions. Odysseus seems to get himself out of many situations, but he seems to put him and his crew in those situations in the first place. He seems to perform for his crew: in that he motivates his crew through his emotion, but all of the passion seems to be not an outpouring of true heart but as a means for an end. Odysseus wants to be remembered; all of his character seems to be his incessent craving for glory, for `kleos`, if you will. One of the reasons he does this is to assert his capability and competence to run his kingdom when he returns.  
He needs his adventures to shore up his slippering identity: his kleos is at stake!  
### Tone/how the book is told
1. Language attuned to acts, not to feelings or motives. We rarely see the feelings of Odysseus
2. Adventure is not a way of experiencing the world, but as a public affair; to gain `kleos` (although both might be true, but rather it is not talked about; we never get Odysseus' motives, or his take on his experiences)
3. Regular people have no place in the poem because they have no `kleos`

## What is setting?
`chronotope`: time space - how the setting sets the timeline (past, present, future) and pace of the story. A hyper futuristic metropolis would have fast paced, forward looking lines of thought about civilization and how the government is run, while a book describing the aftermath of a war would have many flashbacks and reminiscing on previous war experiences and camaraderie.   

## Medieval - Yvain
interlacing of plots
yvain has access to adventures; peasant do not - yet yvain asks the ugly peasant for adventure; and this is how he finds a stone in which he pours water on in order to find adventure (fighting a knight in a storm)  
the juxtaposition between the outside and inside of the castle: where inside, the chivalrous nature of knights are shown, while outside the chaotic nature of the wilderness filled with dragons and adventure takes place  
`Redemption` - redeeming one's status after tarnishing it  
`Vindication` - redeeming one's status that has been tarnished due to external factors  
Reputation vs Anonymity

### Medieval "Noble Violence"
One must go to war, do tournaments; level of courtly love, chivalry.   
Sets the scene, the understanding of the motivations behind actions, the heart of the story.   
### Yvain's identity
He starts off the story as a chivalrous knight, seeking adventure and glory. He chases after his status, showing courtly love to Laudine;   
He dissolves into madness after failing to show his commitment to Laudine, and Laudine rejects him completely, telling him to never return - he ruins himself, and thus the world around him, for life hinges around him (in King Arthur's court, with Laudine, etc). It seems as if the plot moves as his character changes...  
He then redeems himself after doing many noble deeds, coming to Lunete's rescue by fighting off 3 knights, rescuing the sweatshop and maidens of a castle controlled by two demons; even going so far as to offer up his life for Gawain.   
The `lion` is important because it represents his sense of changed identity, his sense of pride and status. It has become part of himself? Externalizing honor  

## Western - Shane
Shane, Myrian, and Starett - Love Triangle  
Based on Wyoming  
The movie is quite symmetrical: 
1. Shane argues with Joe in the beginning and fights with him at the end
2. Joey cocks shotgun in front of Shane, Shane gets shot with shotgun at the end (but doesn't die)
3. Shane emerges from the landscape, shane escapes into the landscape
The movie brings to question whether Joey will grow up to be like Shane, a gunslinger, or Joe, a hardworking farmer
Violence is used as a form of reconciliation, to settle matters
Shane's past as a gunslinger makes him some sort of a ghost, who understands the value of life and the weight of death. (same with Wilson)

## On the Eve of Modernity
Robinson Cruso  
### Terms
`formal realism`:   
1. Claims to authenticity: blurring fact and fiction. To make fiction feel like an authentic report of everyday life.
2. Rejection of conventional plots
3. Individualism
4. Specify temporal and spatial aspects
5. Specify Causality: Things must happen for a reason.
### Plot
1. Grew up in a middle class family: Father does not want Robinson to leave. He wants him to stay at home where it is safe, where he can enjoy the luxury of life. He says to Robinson so profusely. Robinson is deterred for a few weeks or so, but his drive for adventure at sea entices him so much that he leaves without his parents' consent - for neither his mother nor his father would grant him any such thing.
2. Robinson then sailed to sea: the first two times he was nearly swamped. As it were, mountains of water towered over the ship, in which the crew had to chop off the masts in order to stay afloat.
3. Robinson then garnered his own crew and decided to sail out for adventure; however, he was captured by `Moors` (Pirates) and spent two years in captivity. He escaped because he was a fisherman, taking a ship out to sea and throwing off his `Moor` supervisor. He and `Xury` then set off to sail for adventure themselves, freeing themselves from the Pirates.
4. Robinson sails to the island of the Negroes, where he stocks up on corn and water. He kills a few creatures on his way for skin.
5. He is taken in by some European boat. This boat drops him off in Brazil. The captain buys everything he has, giving Robinson a huge fortune. He sells Xury, who wanted to be a seafarer with the Captain as well.
6. He now controls a plantation in Brazil and lives on it for 4 years. If he learned his lesson, he would have stayed: yet his yearning for adventure and sea pushed him to embark on a mission to be able to secretly transport Negroes for their plantations (his and his friends').
7. This voyage goes very poorly, leaving him stranded on a random island far away from Brazil and far away from his comfort based on his Brazil plantation.
